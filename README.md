# SleepMode
## Role
This simple script allow user to quicly switch between different scenarios.
Each scenario has defined apps to run and an energy saving profile.

For instance, the SLEEP mode start UniiefiedRemote, Teamwiever and YoutubeTV to easily use computer as a TV controled from smartphone.

# Settings
You can easily change apps that are started or killed for each profile by editing "sleepmode.ini".
If you add a new one, menu won't auto add it.
You need to add menu line and switch case in code.

# Dumb name
This script names describes it very badly because well.. i just always play some documentary on Youtube from my PC before goinf to bed and fall asleep with running computer.
So initial goal was just to press one macro key on my keyboard to start all my apps to use PC as a TV and auto shutdown after 2h to make sure i don't waste too much energy.
Originally made it so long ago i was still living at my parents place and they were mad to see my computer runing everyday at wakeup.

I later added some not sleep-related profiles.
For instance, i used the MINING profile to quicly start mining Eth before going to work so computer would mine while i was away.
